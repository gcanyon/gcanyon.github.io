    </h3>
    <p>I experimented with generating <a href="http://livecode.com">LiveCode</a> using <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/collections/3742473-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> (linking to their help pages because the main announcement page is broken at the time of writing). LiveCode is fairly obscure, so ChatGPT has much less training data to work with than e.g. for Python.</p>
    <p>tl;dr -- Despite the limited training data, ChatGPT does a good job of generating LiveCode and an excellent job taking direction. And some of its code was better than mine...</p>
    <p>A version of this essay with <em>slight</em> modifications has been published by the LiveCode folks on <a href="https://livecode.com/generating-livecode-using-chatgpt/">their blog</a></p>

      <a href="https://www.liveperson.com/blog/improving-named-entity-recognition/">How implementing a BERT-based model improved precision and recall in recognizing global entities at LivePerson</a>
    </h3>
    <p>Entities are the things, and their attributes, referred to in conversations. Some are recognized using a list: models of cars, for example. Machine-learning is useful for recognizing entities that aren't easily enumerated, like numbers, dates, times, places, currency, and people's names. The model that is trained on a large amount of data that has been labeled with the desired entities.</p>
    <p>tl;dr -- implementing a BERT-based model enabled LivePerson to add new entity types while also improving F1 from 42% to 89%, doubling performance.</p>
