          <h2>Using ChatGPT to generate code in an obscure language</h2>
        </a>
        <p>I experimented with generating <a href="https://livecode.com">LiveCode</a> using <a href="https://openai.com/blog/chatgpt">ChatGPT</a>. LiveCode is fairly obscure, so ChatGPT has much less training data to work with than e.g. for Python.</p>
        <p>tl;dr -- Despite the limited training data, ChatGPT does a good job of generating LiveCode and an excellent job taking direction. And some of its code was better than mine...</p>

          <h2>How implementing a BERT-based model improved precision and recall in recognizing global entities at LivePerson</h2>
        </a>
        <p>Entities are the things, and their attributes, referred to in conversations. Some are recognized using a list: models of cars, for example. Machine-learning is useful for recognizing entities that aren't easily enumerated, like numbers, dates, times, places, currency, and people's names. The model that is trained on a large amount of data that has been labeled with the desired entities.</p>
        <p>tl;dr -- implementing a BERT-based model enabled LivePerson to add new entity types while also improving F1 from 42% to 89%, doubling performance.</p>
