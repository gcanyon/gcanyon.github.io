    <p>I experimented with generating <a href="http://livecode.com">LiveCode</a> using <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/collections/3742473-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> (linking to their help pages because the main announcement page is broken at the time of writing).

And some of its code was better than mine...</p>
