<ul><li><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1W3j5WaFhYZaqSt0ceRQj8j160945gSwG_nyZsCBP6v4/edit#heading=h.y5r34mwzbaar">Using ChatGPT to generate code in an obscure language</a> I experimented with generating <a href="http://livecode.com">LiveCode</a> using <a href="https://help.openai.com/en/collections/3742473-chatgpt">ChatGPT</a> (linking to their help pages because the main announcement page is broken at the time of writing). LiveCode is fairly obscure, so ChatGPT has much less training data to work with than e.g. for Python. Still, ChatGPT manages to do a good job of generating code and an excellent job taking direction. And some of its code was better than mine...</li></ul>
